Responsive Airflow Regulator
This Arduino program automatically controls a fan based on humidity levels using a DHT11 sensor. The fan activates when 
humidity exceeds 90% and turns off when it drops below 70%, ensuring stable environmental conditions. The code integrates 
error handling, retry logic, and calibration offsets to maintain reliable sensor readings while preventing operation failures.

Timed Airflow Regulator
This Arduino-based system automatically cycles a fan on and off based on preset time intervals, ensuring consistent airflow 
regulation. The fan runs for a defined duration before turning off, then remains off for a set period before restarting. 
The program integrates error handling, retry logic for sensor failures, and calibration adjustments for accurate humidity 
and temperature tracking, enhancing reliability and efficiency
