Humidity & Temperature Alarm System (Arduino + DHT11)
This project is an Arduino-based environmental monitoring system that tracks humidity and temperature using a DHT11 sensor and triggers alarms based on defined thresholds. It includes error handling, calibration adjustments, and a retry mechanism to ensure reliable readings even in cases of sensor failure.

Sensor & Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
- DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor
- 5 alarm LEDs (Red, Yellow, Blue, White, Green)
- Red: High humidity alert (>90%)
- Blue: Low humidity alert (<70%)
- Yellow: High temperature alert (>25°C)
- White: Low temperature alert (<20°C)
- Green: Optimal range indicator (20°C–25°C & 70%-90% humidity)
- Resistors for LEDs (optional but recommended)
- Wiring & breadboard for connections
